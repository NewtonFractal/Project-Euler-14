By modular arithmetic every natural number must be either even or odd.

suppose that the longest sequence is produced an even number x.
Then that number x is divided by 2 until it is no longer even.
Since the even number must be less than 1000000 the odd number that is produced by dividing by 2 must be less than 500000.  
So the longest sequence is therefore (an odd number less than 500000)*(2^n) = x , x < 1000000.

otherwise the longest sequence must be produced by an odd number greater than 499999.
