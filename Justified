By modular arithmetic every natural number must be either even or odd.

suppose that the longest sequence is produced an even number x.
It must be greater 499998 because otherwise it can be multiplied by 2.
the number x is divided by 2 until it is no longer even.
Since the even number must be less than 1000000 the odd number that is produced by dividing by 2 must be less than 500000.  
So the longest sequence is therefore (an odd number less than 500000)*(2^n) = x , x < 1000000.

otherwise the longest sequence must be produced by an odd number greater than 499999.
