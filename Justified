By modular arithmetic every natural number must be either even or odd.
I choose to only search for the sequence produced by odd numbers.
If the longest sequence is produced by an odd number less than 499999 then the longest sequence is produced by multiplying the number by 2^n where n is simply the largest integer that makes the number smaller than 1000000. 
otherwise the longest sequence must be produced by an odd number greater than 499999.
